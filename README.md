# Text_editor
A simple GUI app to allow focussed work on my writing.

I'd like a very simple GUI app for my writing and translating work. 
I'll build it with the Tkinter library in Python. 

Some features i'd like are: dark mode, full screen non-distraction mode where the 
current line of text always stays in the middle of the screen and just basic
file open, auto-save each 3 minutes or so.

Eventually i'd love to get the knowledge to be able to create a translation memory 
database. Another idea is to have a database of common student errors for when i'm 
correcting my students' English. It'd be cool to pre-check the work with a script
and apply the corrections for common errors. A strikethrough and a link to a comment
explaining the error. I feel like that could free my time up to focus on some of the 
stylistic points that perhaps are not well suited to a software solution.
